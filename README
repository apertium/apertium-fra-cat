# French and Catalan: `apertium-fra-cat`


This is an Apertium language pair for translating between French and Catalan. What you can use this language package for:

Translating between French and Catalan
Morphological analysis of French and Catalan
Part-of-speech tagging of French and Catalan
For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more information" below.

## Requirements


You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.3.0)
* apertium (>= 3.3.0)
* vislcg3 (>= 0.9.9.10297)
* apertium-fra
* apertium-cat

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: www.apertium.org.

## Compiling


Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

You can use `./autogen.sh` instead of `./configure` you're compiling from
source. If you installed any prerequisite language packages using a `--prefix`
to `./configure`, make sure to give the same `--prefix` to `./configure` here.


## Testing

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following
commands should work:

    $  echo "La plume de ma tante" | apertium -d . fra-cat
    La ploma de la meva tia

    $  echo "La tia" | apertium -d . cat-fra
    La tante

After installing somewhere in `$PATH`, you should be able to do e.g.

    $  echo "NÃ©cessaire" | apertium fra-cat
    Necessari

## Errors


Sometimes when translating, you will notice that a particular word gets translated
with a hash sign in front of it.
This is because of the current lack of transfer rules, which will be fixed in
an upcoming update.
You did not do anything wrong; it was all me.

Additionally, if a word is (not) translated with an asterisk in front of it,
it means that that word is currently not supported and will be added soon.
