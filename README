TRANSLATOR

You need apertium and lttoolbox, versions 3.0, to use
this language-pair package with Apertium.  To compile the linguistic
data simply do:

$ ./configure

to generate a Makefile file and then

$ make

inside of this directory.

TAGGER 

To use this language-pair package with Apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the fr-ca and the ca-fr translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonably way.

If for some reason you need to retrain the tagger (for example, you
have made really extensive changes to the dictionaries such as
creating new lexical categories), please see the documentation on
our wiki at:
